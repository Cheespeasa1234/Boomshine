Apparently this game is originally a javascript / web browser game, so screw you all IM MAKING IT IN JAVA!
Honestly I'm enjoying doing the math for this so far, not because I'm a NORD but b/c its a challenge.
Updates will be often, I hope, until the game works.
# How to play?
Click your mouse at a random position, or maybe a strategic position in order to explode as many bouncing circles at once as you can!
Levels are in progress, but try to get the highest score you can, by hitting as many circles as you can with as few clicks as possible!
# Permissions?
Lmao idk why you would want to use this, but just in case, I do NOT consent to usage of this program, the source code, the binary, or the assets of this project. However, I do consent to usage as long as you inform me through a reasonable contact, such as email or messages.
